    Firstly, user has to register himself/herself by providing details like first name, last name , mobile no and email id.

    Also the user need to provide a recovery Email-Id.

    After providing that details, OTP will be sent on user’s email address and user will have to enter that OTP for authentication.

    After that, the user will be redirected to the login page, where the user can login by providing the email id and password that user had created during registration.

    After entering email id and password, again system will validate user by making him/her to enter OTP.


Authentication using QR code:-

    After registration, QR-code will be generated by system and it’s cryptographic hash will be stored on database.

    System will generate cryptographic hash using one of the algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 and many more. 

    The generated QR-code will be sent on user’s email id, user is supposed to download that QR-code and store on his/her local machine.

    Whenever user wants to login, he/she will have to upload that downloaded QR-code, again system will generate it's cryptographic hash which is supposed to match hash stored on the database.

    If it matches then again OTP will be sent on corresponding email address and user is supposed to  enter that OTP then only he/she will redirected to the dashboard.
