# E Authentication System using OTP and QR-Code
Tried to make a authentication system using OTP and QR-Code.User can register himself/herself by providing minimal details and after that user can login via two ways listed below.

## Login via traditional fashion
Here user can login by providing his credentials after that an OTP will be sent on registered email address and by providing valid OTP user will be redirected to welcome page.


## Login via QR-Code
Here user can login by uploading QR-Code which he/she received after successful registration after uploading that qr-code file again and OTP will be sent on user's email address which he/she is supposed to enter for using our web portal.



# How it works
